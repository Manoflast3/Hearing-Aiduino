# Hearing Aiduino
Hearing Aiduino is an IoT hearing aid using an Arduino 101, sound ampifier, microphone, an ESP8266, various components from the Grove Genuino/Arduino 101 starter kit, and Google's Cloud speech API. 


Currently, this repository is a landing page for the different components of the project. There is some code for the LED display (used for initial debuggin) and some leftover config files from previous development done with PlatformIO

The different components of the project can be found here.
