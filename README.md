# IoTSpeechToText
A WIP IoT hearing aid using an Arduino 101, a Grove kit sound sensor, sound ampifier, microphone, and Google's Cloud speech API. 


Currently, development is proceeding with a NodeMCU and an Arduino UNO, until I get an Arduino 101. The LED display has been implemented, and server-side communication is being tested.


Development done with PlatformIO. Android Integration a possiblity in the future.
